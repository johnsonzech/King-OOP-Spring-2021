Convert the attached C++ code to working Java code.  Don't be afraid to make changes to it, but be judicious in the changes that you make.  

This assignment is not about changing the algorithm, re-writing, or otherwise improving this code.  The point of this assignment is to recognize the differences between C++ and Java, and making the necessary coding changes to accommodate how Java does things.

DO NOT use a built-in Java QUEUE (or any other) container.  

Important!  This assignment will have two due dates.  Submissions received before due date 1 will be worth (potentially) 100 points.  Submissions received after due date 1 but before due date 2 will be worth (potentially) 85 points.  In the first class after due date 1 I will reveal the missing link to making this algorithm work in Java.
